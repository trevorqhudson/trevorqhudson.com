                I am a biomedical engineer and scientist who develops physical sensors. I graduated with my PhD from the Meng Lab at USC in 2021, where I built MEMS sensors and a measurement platform to diagnose shunted patients.

                My research also included an analytical physical model of thermal impedimetric flow sensors which can be used for design iteration in silica. I also worked on a contactless flow sensor for a congenital heart disorder in collaboration with Dr. Vishal Nigam.

                I graduated with a BS in Bioengineering from Rice University in 2014. Prior to grad school, I researched at the Naval Research Lab in Washington D.C., the Grande-Allen and McDevitt labs at Rice, and the Swanson lab at the UW in Seattle.
